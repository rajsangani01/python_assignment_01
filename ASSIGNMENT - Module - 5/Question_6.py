# What is a QuerySet?Write program to create a new Post object in database:


# A queryset is simply a list of objects from the Django Models. 
# When using the Django ORM creating a new row in the table is simply like creating a new object of Model class. 
# Django ORM maps these Model objects to Relational database query. 
# Any SQL query can be written easily as Django queryset.
