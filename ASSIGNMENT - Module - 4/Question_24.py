# What is used to check whether an object o is an instance of class A?

# Python code for isinstance()

# class Test:
# 	a = 5


# TestInstance = Test()

# print(isinstance(TestInstance, Test))
# print(isinstance(TestInstance, (list, tuple)))
# print(isinstance(TestInstance, (list, tuple, Test)))



# x = isinstance("Hello", (float, int, str, list, dict, tuple))
# print(x)

i = isinstance(23.9,(float, int, str))
print(i)
