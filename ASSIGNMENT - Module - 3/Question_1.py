# What is List? How will you reverse a list?

# ANSWER-->>
'''A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, 
ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. 
Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ] '''

x = [121,"python",True,12.12,None]
x.reverse()
print(x)
