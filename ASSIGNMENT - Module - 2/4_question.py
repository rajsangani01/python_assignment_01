# HOW MEMORY MANAGE IN PYTHON. <---->

'''
Understanding Memory allocation is important to any software developer as writing efficient code means writing a memory-efficient code. 
Memory allocation can be defined as allocating a block of space in the computer memory to a program. 
In Python memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic as the Python developers created a garbage collector for Python 
so that the user does not have to do manual garbage collection.
'''

# Garbage Collection :

'''Garbage collection is a process in which the interpreter frees up the memory,
when not in use to make it available for other objects.
Assume a case where no reference is pointing to an object in memory i.e. it is not in use so, 
the virtual machine has a garbage collector that automatically deletes that object from the heap memory. '''
